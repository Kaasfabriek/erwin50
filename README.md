This project was created to congratulate Erwin (the geeky way) for his 50th birthday.

What this project does:
Birthday wishes (text messages) are entered on the website http://erwin50.nl/
From here, the message goes through the TNN (https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/) where it is send using LoRa.
The LoRa module that picks up the message is connected to an Arduino and a LCD display.
Once the message is received, the display (and a few added LEDs) blinks, counts to 50 and then displays the message.


Included are:
Use a display to put a messenge on
Make a website to congratulate erwin
With a database
Setup a lora key and uplink connectivity from the webserver
Program the arduino with rmf95 to put the messenge from lora on the display
